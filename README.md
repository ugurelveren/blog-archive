# My Personal Blog

Welcome to my personal blog, where I share my thoughts, experiences, and tips on various topics. This blog is built using **Markdown** and rendered with **marked.js**. It's hosted on GitHub and is simple to navigate and contribute to.

## Features

- **Markdown-Based:** All blog posts are written in Markdown for simplicity.
- **Rendered with marked.js:** Fast and lightweight Markdown parsing and rendering.
- **GitHub Hosted:** All content is hosted on GitHub, making it easy to track changes.
- **Developer-Friendly Design:** Simple, clean, and focused on content.

## Serving the Project Locally
To run the project in a development environment, you can use the `serve` command. This will launch a local server to serve the static files. Make sure you have `serve` installed (you can install it with `npm install -g serve`).

Run the following command:

```bash
serve -s . -p 8000
```
- `-s` Serves the current directory as static files.
- `-p 8000` Specifies the port number (8000 in this case).

This will make your project available at `http://localhost:8000`.
