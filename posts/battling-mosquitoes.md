# Battling Mosquitoes: A Personal Journey

In late August, southern California faced a mosquito invasion. These tiny pests seemed to appear out of nowhere, leaving their itchy marks on unsuspecting victims. Whether you had a bug screen or not, they found their way into your home, and you'd wake up with irritating mosquito bites. At first, you might not notice them, but as time passed, the incessant itching would become undeniable.

These mosquitoes were notorious for targeting ankles, leaving small, pink, and itchy bites. Sometimes, you'd wake up with not just one or two but possibly three or more bites. The constant itching would make you want to scratch your ankles, especially when walking. It was nearly impossible to scratch them all the time, like when driving, where you'd long for relief.

By the end of the day, you'd have scratched your ankles raw, and the next day, it would only get worse. Congratulations, you'd have itchy scars and mosquito bites.

After a few weeks, I had to confront the mosquito problem plaguing us. The constant itching was unbearable, and even my precious puppies were not spared. Seeing my dog helplessly bothered by these mosquitoes, I decided it was time to take action.

I began wearing socks before sleeping and opted to use the air conditioner instead of opening windows. It made a difference, and though I still spotted the occasional mosquito, I became adept at swatting them before they could bite. Sleeping in socks and long sleeves also helped.

One day, I had a fantastic night out with friends, celebrating something special. I returned home late, exhausted, and in my tired state, I forgot about the mosquito problem. I kept the window open to enjoy the ocean breeze, and by morning, I was covered in fresh mosquito bites. These pests had taken advantage of my lapse in vigilance.

I realized I needed to confront this problem head-on. Passive measures weren't effective. So, I declared war. I ordered bug zappers and mosquito-killing sprays. Before sleeping, I abandoned socks and long sleeves, choosing instead to check the lights and eliminate any mosquitoes. There were a few nights I forgot, but the bug zappers and previous efforts paid off. It was initially a bit scary and required effort, but I learned that ignoring the problem was more costly. My quality of life improved, and I woke up without disturbances. Occasionally, there were accidents, especially when I ventured outside my “castle.” I went shopping and returned with a couple of bites, but this taught me to be prepared. I learned to identify areas prone to mosquitoes and took precautions with repellent body spray.

The key was accepting that I had a problem, taking proactive steps to combat it, and arming myself with solutions to alleviate the bites during my ongoing battle with these pesky insects.
